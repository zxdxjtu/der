# DER: Direct Executable Representation
## A Language for AI-Native Development
### Version 0.1 - Initial Draft

---

## 1. Introduction & Guiding Philosophy

DER (Direct Executable Representation) is not a programming language in the traditional sense; it is a **paradigm for AI-driven software creation**. It is founded on the principle that for an AI to generate, optimize, and evolve software efficiently, the code itself must be a machine-native, formally verifiable, and directly executable data structure, rather than human-readable text.

The core philosophies are:

*   **Representation is Reality:** The "source code" (a DER binary blob) is a direct, 1:1 representation of the program's computational graph. There is no ambiguous syntax or complex parsing. **Code is the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).**
*   **Trust through Proof:** Every significant logical unit generated by an AI must be accompanied by a formal proof of its correctness and safety, verifiable by the runtime. This is inspired by Rust's compile-time safety guarantees but elevated to the semantic level.
*   **Human as Architect, AI as Implementer:** The development process shifts from humans writing line-by-line code to defining high-level intent, constraints, and goals. The AI translates this intent into a provably correct DER implementation.
*   **Universal Compute Fabric:** DER is designed to be a universal intermediate representation, capable of describing any computation—from backend logic and scientific computing to frontend UI rendering—and compiling it efficiently for any target platform, akin to the cross-platform promise of Java's JVM or WebAssembly.

## 2. Top-Level Architecture: The DER Ecosystem

The DER ecosystem consists of five primary components:

1.  **DER Binary Format:** The heart of the language. A compact, binary specification for computational graphs.
2.  **DER Runtime Environment (DRE):** A secure, cross-platform virtual machine that loads, verifies, and executes DER programs.
3.  **Intent-to-DER Compiler (IDC):** An AI system that translates human intent into DER programs. This is the "IDE" of the future.
4.  **Formal Verification Engine (FVE):** A component of the DRE and IDC that generates and checks proofs of correctness for DER logic.
5.  **Visualization & Debugging Engine (VDE):** A tool that renders DER programs into human-understandable text or interactive diagrams, highlighting changes and data flow.

## 3. The DER Binary Format Specification

A DER file (`.der`) is a structured binary file. It is composed of several "chunks," identified by a 4-byte tag.

| Chunk Tag | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DERH` | **Header** | File metadata, version, target hints, checksum. |
| `META` | **Metadata** | Human-readable descriptions, authoring AI info, intent source. |
| `CPOOL`| **Constant Pool** | Storage for all constant data (numbers, strings, tensors). |
| `DEFN` | **Definitions** | Type, function, and trait definitions. |
| `IMPL` | **Implementation** | The core computational graph nodes. |
| `PROF` | **Proof** | Formal proof data associated with the implementation. |

### 3.1. Implementation Chunk (`IMPL`) - The Core Logic

This chunk contains a list of **Nodes**. Each node is a fixed-size binary structure.

**Node Structure (16 bytes):**

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 2 | `OpCode` | Unsigned 16-bit integer identifying the operation (e.g., `0x0101` for `F32.Add`). |
| 2 | 2 | `Flags` | 16 flags for node properties (e.g., `IS_ASYNC`, `IS_PURE`). |
| 4 | 4 | `ResultID` | A unique 32-bit identifier for this node's output. |
| 8 | 4 | `Timestamp` | Nanosecond timestamp of this node's creation/last modification. |
| 12 | 4 | `ArgCount` | Number of arguments this node takes. |

Immediately following this structure are the `ArgCount` arguments, which are themselves `ResultID`s pointing to other nodes.

**Example: `c = a + b`**
Let's say `a` is `ResultID: 1` and `b` is `ResultID: 2`. The node for `c` would be:
*   `OpCode`: `F32.Add`
*   `ResultID`: `3`
*   `ArgCount`: `2`
*   Arguments: `[1, 2]`

This structure is extremely fast to load and traverse. There is no "lexical analysis" or "parsing" in the traditional sense. The loader simply maps this region of the file into memory.

## 4. The DER Runtime Environment (DRE)

The DRE is the secure virtual machine that executes DER programs. It is the equivalent of the JVM or the .NET CLR.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1.  **Loading & Linking:** Loads a root `.der` file and any dependencies. It resolves `ResultID`s and builds an in-memory graph representation.
2.  **Formal Verification:** Before execution, it passes the `IMPL` and `PROF` chunks to the **Formal Verification Engine (FVE)**. If the proof fails to validate the implementation against its defined traits and constraints, the program is rejected.
3.  **JIT Compilation & Execution:** The DRE walks the verified graph and uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to translate the platform-agnostic DER opcodes into highly optimized native machine code for the target architecture (x86-64, ARM, RISC-V, or even GPU shaders like SPIR-V/WGSL).
4.  **Sandboxing:** All execution is sandboxed. A DER program must declare its required capabilities (e.g., filesystem access, network I/O) in its `META` chunk. The DRE enforces these permissions, preventing unauthorized actions.
5.  **Cross-Platform Abstraction:** The DRE provides a consistent API for platform services (I/O, threading, UI rendering), which DER opcodes can target. This is how DER achieves "write once, run anywhere."

## 5. Formal Verification Engine (FVE)

This is DER's cornerstone of trust. It uses techniques from proof assistants like Coq or Lean, but in a fully automated way.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Trait-Based Specification:** In the `DEFN` chunk, a function can be defined with traits. Example: `fn sort(list: List<T>) -> List<T> where T: Ord traits IsSorted, PreservesLength;`
2.  **Proof Generation (by IDC):** When the Intent-to-DER Compiler (IDC) generates the graph for the `sort` function, it must also generate a formal proof in the `PROF` chunk that the graph's logic satisfies the `IsSorted` and `PreservesLength` traits.
3.  **Proof Checking (by DRE):** The DRE's FVE is not a prover; it is a much simpler and faster **proof checker**. It takes the implementation graph and the provided proof and confirms that the proof is valid. This is computationally cheaper than generating the proof from scratch.

This creates a powerful contract: **if a DER program runs, it is not just type-safe, but semantically correct with respect to its declared specifications.**

## 6. Visualization & Debugging Engine (VDE)

The VDE is the primary human interface to DER. It is a standalone tool or a component within a larger "Intent IDE."

**Features:**

1.  **DER-to-Text/Image Rendering:** It reads a `.der` file and can render it in multiple ways:
    *   **Descriptive Text:** "Function 'CreateUser' takes a 'User' object. It first hashes the password field using Blake3, then inserts the new object into the 'Users' database table. Returns a boolean success status."
    *   **Interactive Graph:** A pannable, zoomable 2D graph visualization (like a node editor) showing the flow of data.
2.  **Semantic Diffing:** When comparing two `.der` files, the VDE identifies and highlights changes at the semantic level: "Node 'HashPassword' was changed from SHA256 to Blake3." It uses the `Timestamp` on each node to efficiently find modified sections.
3.  **Live Data Probing:** When connected to a running DRE, the VDE can overlay real-time data values on the graph visualization, showing how data is being transformed at each step.

## 7. Cross-Platform & Frontend Rendering

DER achieves universal reach by abstracting the presentation layer.

**The `RenderTree` Opcode:**

*   There is a special set of opcodes for UI, e.g., `UI.CreateElement`, `UI.SetAttribute`, `UI.AddChild`.
*   The core logic of a DER program produces a result that is a `RenderTree` object, which is a data structure describing a platform-agnostic UI tree (similar to React's virtual DOM).
*   **Platform-Specific Renderers:** The DRE on each platform has a native renderer.
    *   On Windows, it translates the `RenderTree` into WinUI components.
    *   On the web, it translates it into DOM elements.
    *   On macOS, into AppKit/SwiftUI views.
*   **Event Handling:** UI events (clicks, keypresses) are fed back into the DRE as standard async events, which can be wired to any part of the computational graph, allowing for complex, declarative UI logic without traditional callbacks.

This makes DER a true full-stack solution. The same language and runtime can power the backend database query, the intermediate business logic, and the final UI rendering, all within a single, verifiable framework.

## 8. Foreign Execution Interface (FXI)

To solve the "cold start" problem of a new ecosystem and leverage millions of existing libraries, DER must provide a robust, secure, and efficient way to interoperate with other languages. This is achieved through the Foreign Execution Interface (FXI), a first-class citizen of the DER architecture.

### 8.1. The Philosophy: Controlled Un-safety

The core challenge of FXI is that any external call is a "black box" to the Formal Verification Engine (FVE), breaking the chain of trust. DER addresses this by embracing the concept of **controlled and explicit un-safety**.

*   Any DER function that contains an FXI call must be marked with the `unsafe` keyword.
*   The DRE enforces stricter sandboxing and permission checks on `unsafe` functions.
*   This makes it clear to developers and auditors exactly where the "provably safe" world of DER ends and the "trusted by convention" world of external code begins.

### 8.2. Architecture & Implementation

1.  **`FXI.Call` Opcode:** A new opcode is defined to represent an external call. Its arguments specify the target language, module, function, and input arguments.
2.  **Dependency Manifest:** The `META` chunk of a `.der` file is extended to include a `foreign_dependencies` section, declaring required runtimes (e.g., Python >= 3.9) and packages (e.g., `numpy==1.23.5`).
3.  **DRE Bridges:** The DRE includes embedded runtimes or bindings to external ones. The primary targets are:
    *   **Python Bridge:** For data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. The DRE will embed a CPython interpreter (using libraries like PyO3 if the DRE is in Rust) to execute Python calls.
    *   **JavaScript/TypeScript Bridge (via Node.js):** For I/O-intensive tasks, web services, and ecosystem tooling. The DRE will embed a V8 engine instance.
4.  **Data Marshalling:** Efficient data transfer is critical. For large numerical/tensor data, Apache Arrow will be used as the zero-copy interchange format between DER and Python (e.g., NumPy/Pandas). For general objects, a fast binary serialization format like MessagePack will be used.

### 8.3. Target Languages

*   **Tier 1 (Core Support):** Python and JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js). These two cover the vast majority of modern development needs and will be the focus of initial FXI development.
*   **Tier 2 (Future Support):** Languages like Rust (for performance-critical native code), and potentially Java/C# to integrate with large enterprise systems.

The FXI transforms DER from a theoretical ideal into a pragmatic powerhouse, capable of orchestrating existing ecosystems while providing a new layer of verification, security, and performance.
