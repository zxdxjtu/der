# DER: Dynamic Execution Representation

DER is a revolutionary programming paradigm designed specifically for AI as the primary coder, with humans serving as architects who define intent and view results through visualization tools.

## Core Philosophy

- **AI-First Design**: Binary computational graphs instead of text-based syntax
- **Proof-Carrying Code**: Every program includes formal proofs of correctness
- **Universal Computation**: One format for all types of computation (backend, frontend, data processing)
- **Human Visualization**: Humans interact through visual representations, not code editing

## Architecture

### 1. Binary Format
- Compact 16-byte node structures
- Direct memory mapping for execution
- No parsing required - the code IS the AST

### 2. Runtime Environment (DRE)
- Secure, sandboxed execution
- JIT compilation to native code
- Cross-platform support (x86, ARM, RISC-V, GPU)

### 3. AI Translator
- Converts human intent to DER programs
- Generates formal proofs alongside code
- Ensures semantic correctness

### 4. Visualization Engine
- Multiple rendering formats (DOT, Mermaid, text)
- Interactive graph exploration
- Real-time execution visualization

## Key Features

### For AI:
- No syntax ambiguity
- Direct graph manipulation
- Integrated proof generation
- Timestamp-based change tracking

### For Humans:
- Natural language intent specification
- Visual program understanding
- Guaranteed correctness through proofs
- No need to write or read code

## Example

```rust
// AI receives: "Calculate (10 + 20) * (30 - 25)"
// AI generates binary computational graph
// Human sees:

Node 7 [Mul]: Multiplication
├─ Node 5 [Add]: Addition
│  ├─ Node 1 [ConstInt]: 10
│  ├─ Node 2 [ConstInt]: 20
├─ Node 6 [Sub]: Subtraction
   ├─ Node 3 [ConstInt]: 30
   ├─ Node 4 [ConstInt]: 25

Result: 150
```

## Getting Started

```rust
use der::compiler::AICodeGenerator;

let mut generator = AICodeGenerator::new();
let program = generator.generate_from_prompt("add 10 and 20")?;
let mut executor = Executor::new(program);
let result = executor.execute()?;
```

## Vision

DER represents a fundamental shift in programming where:
- AI handles all implementation details
- Humans focus on high-level architecture
- Code correctness is mathematically proven
- The gap between intent and implementation disappears

This is not just a new language - it's a new paradigm for the AI era of software development.
