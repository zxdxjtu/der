# DER: Dynamic Execution Representation

> **DER: Prompt as src, Code as bin**

DER is a revolutionary programming paradigm designed specifically for AI as the primary coder, with humans serving as architects who define intent and view results through visualization tools.

## Core Philosophy

- **AI-First Design**: Binary computational graphs instead of text-based syntax
- **Proof-Carrying Code**: Every program includes formal proofs of correctness
- **Universal Computation**: One format for all types of computation (backend, frontend, data processing)
- **Human Visualization**: Humans interact through visual representations, not code editing

## Architecture

### 1. Binary Format
- Compact 16-byte node structures
- Direct memory mapping for execution
- No parsing required - the code IS the AST

### 2. Runtime Environment (DRE)
- Secure, sandboxed execution
- JIT compilation to native code
- Cross-platform support (x86, ARM, RISC-V, GPU)

### 3. AI Translator
- Converts human intent to DER programs
- Generates formal proofs alongside code
- Ensures semantic correctness

### 4. Visualization Engine
- Multiple rendering formats (DOT, Mermaid, text)
- Interactive graph exploration
- Real-time execution visualization

## Key Features

### For AI:
- No syntax ambiguity
- Direct graph manipulation
- Integrated proof generation
- Timestamp-based change tracking

### For Humans:
- Natural language intent specification
- Visual program understanding
- Guaranteed correctness through proofs
- No need to write or read code

## Example

```rust
// AI receives: "Calculate (10 + 20) * (30 - 25)"
// AI generates binary computational graph
// Human sees:

Node 7 [Mul]: Multiplication
├─ Node 5 [Add]: Addition
│  ├─ Node 1 [ConstInt]: 10
│  ├─ Node 2 [ConstInt]: 20
├─ Node 6 [Sub]: Subtraction
   ├─ Node 3 [ConstInt]: 30
   ├─ Node 4 [ConstInt]: 25

Result: 150
```

## Getting Started

```rust
use der::compiler::AICodeGenerator;

let mut generator = AICodeGenerator::new();
let program = generator.generate_from_prompt("add 10 and 20")?;
let mut executor = Executor::new(program);
let result = executor.execute()?;
```

## Future: AI-Native Documentation

DER's binary computational graphs represent just the beginning of AI-native software development. We envision a future where DER programs are accompanied by **AI-native description files** that provide comprehensive context about each binary program.

### Context Engineering Integration

Drawing inspiration from [context-engineering methodologies](https://github.com/zxdxjtu/context-engineering-intro/tree/main), these description files would include:

- **Purpose & Intent**: Precise natural language description of what the program does
- **Input/Output Contracts**: Formal specifications of expected inputs and guaranteed outputs  
- **Verification Methods**: Embedded formal verification proofs and testing strategies
- **Usage Context**: When, where, and how the program should be used
- **Safety Guarantees**: Computational complexity bounds and resource usage constraints

### Open Design Question

The exact implementation approach remains an active area of research:

**Option A: Language-Integrated**
- Description files as part of the DER language specification
- Native support in the compiler and runtime
- Tight coupling with binary format and execution model

**Option B: Language-Agnostic Contract**
- Description files as universal context-engineering contracts
- Could apply to any programming language or binary format
- Standardized interface for AI systems to understand and manipulate code

This design choice will significantly impact how AI systems interact with code in the future, and we welcome community input on this fundamental architectural decision.

## Vision

DER represents a fundamental shift in programming where:
- AI handles all implementation details
- Humans focus on high-level architecture
- Code correctness is mathematically proven
- The gap between intent and implementation disappears

This is not just a new language - it's a new paradigm for the AI era of software development.
